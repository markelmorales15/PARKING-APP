## Implementation approach
The Private Garage Rental App will be built using Node.js and Express for the backend, PostgreSQL for the database, and Firebase Admin SDK for authentication and notifications. JWT will be used for session management, and environment variables will be managed using `.env`. The architecture will focus on modularity and scalability, ensuring that core features like authentication, garage listing, and booking are implemented efficiently.

### Difficult Points
1. **Authentication**: Integrating both email/password and Google login securely.
2. **Search and Booking**: Implementing efficient filtering and booking mechanisms.
3. **Garage Listing**: Handling photo uploads and metadata storage.

### Open-Source Libraries
- **Express.js**: For building the backend API.
- **pg**: PostgreSQL client for Node.js.
- **Firebase Admin SDK**: For authentication and notifications.
- **jsonwebtoken**: For JWT session management.
- **multer**: For handling file uploads (photos).

## Program call flow
Refer to the file `private_garage_rental_app_sequence_diagram.mermaid` for detailed sequence diagrams.

## Anything UNCLEAR
1. Should the app support long-term bookings?
2. What is the maximum number of photos allowed per listing?
3. Should there be a rating system for garages?
